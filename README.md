Simple spring-based web application. Tested with Apache Tomcat 7.0.40.

How to configure:

1) Create database with parameters from bean dataSource in dispatcher-servlet.xml, or reconfigure data source in xml.

2) Start application - hibernate configuration is not like in production mode, so it will create tables automatically.

3) Apply init.sql from application resources.


Now you can log in with login=admin and password=admin
